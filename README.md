# South Bend Events Scraper & Live Calendar Sync (V2)

An asynchronous scraper and automated iCalendar (`.ics`) generator for [Visit South Bend](https://www.visitsouthbend.com/events/).

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Asynchronous Scraping**: Powered by Playwright with concurrency-controlled detail extraction.
- **Smart Date/Time Parsing**: Intelligent range parsing, weekday recurrence filters (`Wednesday - Sunday`, `Fridays`), and year rollover support.
- **RFC 5545 iCalendar Compliant**: Generates valid `.ics` calendars with strict 75-octet line folding, deterministic SHA-256 UIDs, character escaping, and `America/Indiana/Indianapolis` timezone definitions.
- **Automated GitHub Actions Sync**: Runs twice daily on a schedule or on demand via Inbound Webhooks.
- **Live Calendar Subscription**: Subscribe once via `webcal://` in Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, or Microsoft Outlook for automatic background updates.
- **Outbound Webhook Notifications**: Dispatches rich summary updates to Discord, Slack, or custom webhooks whenever new events are added.

## 🔗 Inbound Webhook: Trigger on Demand

You can trigger the scraper remotely (from a home server, Zapier, or website change monitor) by sending an HTTP POST request to GitHub's `repository_dispatch` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO>/dispatches \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_GITHUB_PAT>" \
  -d '{"event_type": "update-calendar"}'
```

> **Note**: `<YOUR_GITHUB_PAT>` is a GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` or `contents:write` scope.

---

## 🔔 Outbound Webhooks (Discord / Slack Notifications)

To receive a notification whenever new events are added:
1. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
2. Add a new secret named `WEBHOOK_URL` containing your Discord or Slack webhook URL.
3. On every run with detected changes, a summary of added and removed events will be posted automatically.
